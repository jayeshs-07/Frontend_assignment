    </p>
    <h1>What are the disadvantages of CSS</h1>
    <p>1 Performance Impact <br>
        Extensive or poorly optimized CSS files can slow down page load times. It's essential to minimize and optimize
        CSS to maintain optimal website performance.<br><br>
        2. Overriding Styles <br>
        The "cascading" nature of CSS can sometimes lead to unexpected styling conflicts. Specificity and the order in
        which styles are applied can result in unintended consequences.
    </p>
    <h1>What is the difference between CSS2 and CSS3?</h1>
    <p>
        CSS was originally released in 1996 and consists of properties for adding font properties such as typeface and
        emphasis color of text, backgrounds, and other elements. CSS2 was released in 1998 with added styles for other
        media types so that it can be used for page layout designing. CSS3 was released in 1999 and presentation-style
        properties were added in it that allows you to build a presentation from documents.
    </p>
    <h1>Name a few CSS style components</h1>
    <p>
        There are three types of CSS which are given below:<br>
        Inline CSS <br>
        Internal or Embedded CSS <br>
        External CSS <br>
    </p>
    <h1>What do you understand by CSS opacity</h1>
    <p>
        The opacity CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an
        element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency
    </p>
    <h1>How can the background color of an element be changed.</h1>
    <p>
        To add background color in HTML, use the CSS background-color property. Set it to the color name or code you
        want and place it inside a style attribute
    </p>
    <h1>How can image repetition of the backup be controlled</h1>
    <p>
        This task can be achieved by using the background-repeat property that will help us to control the repetition of
        the image. The background-repeat property in CSS is used to repeat the background image both horizontally and
        vertically.
    </p>
    <h1>What is the use of the background-position property?</h1>
    <p>
        The background-position property sets the starting position of a background image.
    </p>
    <h1>Which property controls the image scroll in the background?</h1>
    <p>
        The background-attachment property sets whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page, or is
        fixed.
    </p>
    <h1>Why should background and color be used as separate properties?</h1>
    <p>
        It enhances the legibility of style sheets. The background property is a complex property in CSS, and if it is
        combined with color, the complexity will further increase.
    </p>
    <h1>How to center block elements using CSS1</h1>
    <p>
        To centrally align the block elements, we can simply make use of the < center> tag. All the elements within the
            < center> tag will be centrally aligned.
    </p>
    <h1>How to maintain the CSS specifications?</h1>
    <p>
        The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
    </p>
    <h1>What are the ways to integrate CSS as a web page ?</h1>
    <p>
        CSS may be added to HTML in three different ways. To style a single HTML element on the page, use Inline CSS in
        a style attribute. By adding CSS to the head section of our HTML document, we can embed an internal stylesheet.
        We can also connect to an external stylesheet that separates our CSS from our HTML
    </p>
    <h1>What is embedded style sheets?</h1>
    <p>
        An embedded style sheet is declared within the < head> element of an XHTML document. It applies to the whole
            document, rather than just one element. Each style declaration (or CSS rule) gets applied to everything in
            the document that matches that rule.
    </p>
    <h1>What are the external style sheets?</h1>
    <p>
        A separate CSS file that can be accessed by creating a link within the head section of the webpage.
    </p>
    <h1>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using external style sheets?</h1>
    <p>
        Modularity and Maintainability: By using external style sheets, you separate your CSS code from your HTML code

        External style sheets allow you to maintain a consistent look and feel across your entire website
    </p>
    <h1>What is the meaning of the CSS selector?</h1>
    <p>
        a pattern of elements and other terms that tell the browser which HTML elements should be selected to have the
        CSS property values inside the rule applied to them.
    </p>
    <h1>What are the media types allowed by CSS</h1>
    <p>
        CSS3 Media Types <br>
        all Used for all media type devices <br><br>
        print Used for printers <br>
        screen Used for computer screens, tablets, smart-phones etc. <br>
        speech Used for screenreaders that "reads" the page out loud <br>
    </p>
    <h1>
        What is the rule set
    </h1>
    <p>
        Each (valid) declaration block is preceded by one or more comma-separated selectors, which are conditions
        selecting some elements of the page. A selector list and an associated declarations block, together, are called
        a ruleset, or often a rule.
